## Recommendations for EtherCAT Open-Source Master Users  

1. **Use a Real-Time Kernel System**  
   Ensure your operating system has a real-time kernel to guarantee consistent and precise communication.

2. **Isolate CPU Cores**  
   Perform CPU isolation to dedicate specific cores to EtherCAT processes, reducing interruptions and improving stability.

3. **Troubleshooting OP State Issues**  
   - Failure to enter OP state may be caused by errors in the **object dictionary mapping** or improper configuration of **DC (Distributed Clock) mode**.  
   - **eRob** only supports **DC mode**, and proper configuration of DC mode is crucial for system synchronization and precision.

4. **Read Mode-Specific Instructions**  
   Before using each mode, read the relevant operational instructions to ensure correct configuration and usage.

5. **Use the Official eRob Upper Computer Software**  
   eRob provides official upper computer software. Mastering the built-in **oscilloscope tool** will allow you to quickly locate issues with the EtherCAT master.

6. **Capture and Analyze EtherCAT Data**  
   Use packet capture tools to analyze EtherCAT output and log information to identify errors.


## Installation

1. install eRob-SOEM-Linux
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeroErrControl/eRob_SOEM_linux.git
cd eRob_SOEM_linux
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

```

## Usage
### Running demo:

1. CSV mode:
```bash
sudo ./build/demo/eRob_CSV
```

2. Launch the position subscriber (PP):
```bash
sudo ./build/demo/eRob_PP_subscriber
python3 src/erob_ros/src/eCoder_fake.py
```

3. Launch the position subscriber (CSP):
```bash
sudo ./build/demo/eRob_CSP_subscriber
python3 src/erob_ros/src/eCoder_fake.py
``` 

4. Launch the cyclic synchronous position mode (CSP):
```bash
sudo ./build/demo/eRob_CSP
``` 

5. Launch the profile torque mode (PT):
In this mode, we can control the torque of the servo motor and have added PDO mapping to obtain the position, speed, torque, and status word of the servo motor. 

```bash
sudo ./build/demo/eRob_PT
``` 
If you want to consult the object dictionary, you can run the following command and then run `sudo ./build/test/linux/slaveinfo <ethercat_device> -map` to view the object dictionary.


6. Launch the cyclic synchronous torque mode (CST):
In this mode, we can control the torque of the servo motor and have added PDO mapping to obtain the position, speed, torque, and status word of the servo motor. 

```bash
sudo ./build/demo/eRob_CST
``` 
If you want to consult the object dictionary, you can run the following command and then run `sudo ./build/test/linux/slaveinfo <ethercat_device> -map` to view the object dictionary.
